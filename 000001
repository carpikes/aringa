<html><body><xmp>Arin.Ga - Url shortner, file sharer and time waster.
====================

To post your content here, just send a POST request to arin.ga like this:
  curl -F "d=random quote" arin.ga
  curl -F "d=<php code" arin.ga
  curl -F "d=<funny picture" -F "t=png" arin.ga

By sending that request, you agree not to post illegal or child porn stuff.
You also agree not to abuse this service for spamming purposes and such.

Your data will be stored forever.



File type
--------------------

Type parameter `t` should be a 3 bytes string.

Known types:

- pdf
- zip
- gif
- png
- jpg
- url
- no type (see below)

If your type is in that list, a proper header will be applied. Do you want to
post an html page? Just use a different type (e.g.: `htm`) and it will be
rendered raw.

If type is `url`, a short redirect url will be generated.

If no type (or type `000`) is provided, your data will be treated as code and
displayed with as few changes as possible, namely:

- `\n`, `\r` etc. will be converted to newlines etc.
  Protip: escape `\` in your code with `\\`
- a zero width space (U+200B) will be inserted between `<` and `/xmp>`

Do not post stuff with type longer or shorter than 3 bytes unless you're ready
to get garbage output.



What's the maximum file size?
-------------------

10 MiB. Should be enough for most code snippets and cat pictures.



Are you encrypting my data? Do you store them safely?
--------------------

No.



Is this thing open source?
--------------------

Arin.Ga is distributed under the MIT License.

You can find the source on github: https://github.com/izabera/aringa



Why this weird name?
--------------------

Mostly because `.ga` domains are free if they're longer than 3 letters, so I
just picked a random short word that ends in `ga`.

Bonus: `aringa` is a fish in italian. Doesn't make much sense, I guess.



Who made this?
--------------------

I'm izabera, 22 f italy.

You can usually find me on freenode irc or send a mail to
izaberina at google's mail dot com
